# Introduction
Post-error slowing (PES) describes the increase in response time on trials following an error compared to trials following a correct response. PES has been observed in a variety of experimental settings and is often accompanied by a post-error change in accuracy (PEA). Some studies observed decreased accuracy following errors while others find accuracy improvements. This has lead researchers to investigate differences in cognitive processes underlying post-error effects.

@damaso2020 have argued that different types of errors can lead to different types of post-error changes in behavior. They differentiate between _response speed_ and _evidence quality_ errors. 

Damaso et al. used median splits in RT to show that behavioral differences within-task exist between the two types. They observed increased PES for the faster bin of errors and post-error speeding for the bin containing mainly _evidence quality_ errors. Only measuring RT and accuracy changes provides a limited view of post-error effects and fails to capture differences in cognitive processes following the different types of errors. This RT approach is also highly susceptible to _regression to the mean_. We will aim to improve on the research design of @damaso2020 by adding 2 tasks each eliciting either _response speed_ or _evidence quality_ errors and using neurocognitive measures to measure post-error changes in cognitive processes. 

To elicit both _evidence quality_ and _response speed_ errors we will use a modified flanker task that has led to high error rates in previous studies [@mcgovern2017]. Participants have to decide whether the centrally presented letter is a "U" or a "V". This central letter is surrounded by flanking letters that either show the same letter (congruent) or the respective other letter (incongruent). This task elicits both _evidence quality and _response speed_ errors. We will determine the type of error via the RT of the error in a manner similar to @damaso2020.

We will use a modified _Behavioral Adaptation Task_ @hedge2007 to elicit response speed errors. The stimuli "X" and "Y" are presented in a mostly alternating fashion. When the current stimulus is different from the previously presented stimulus, participants have to press the button corresponding to the stimulus. When the stimulus is repeated, participants should give no response at all. This leads to a large number of _response speed_ errors.

To elicit mainly _evidence quality_ errors we will use a difficult two-choice color discrimination task [@buzzel2017]. A stimulus consistent of a smaller circle surrounded by a bigger circle is presented each trial. The participant has to decide whether the inner circle is of the same color as the outer ring. The true difference in colors in incongruent stimuli will be adapted to each participant to ensure error rates of 20%. Errors in this task are mainly due to participants being unsure of whether there is a true difference and thus compromise largely _evidence quality_ errors.

Differences in post-error adjustments to cognitive processes will be studied in several measurements obtained in an electroencephalogram (EEG). This includes error-related components in event-related potentials (ERP), the _error-related negativity_ (ERN) and _error-positivity_ (Pe). We will also investigate the impact of errors on alpha power. 

ERN is a fronto-central negative deflection in the response-locked ERP that is more negative following error responses. It peaks around 100ms after the response and is often associated with error monitoring or response conflict [@botvinnik2001].
Pe on the other hand is a centro-parietal positive deflection around 200-400ms following the response. The functional interpretation of this component is less clear. It seems to be a later stage of error processing relevant for error awareness [@gregorio2018].
Alpha waves are rhythmic oscillations between 8-13Hz reflecting low mental arousal [@niedermeyer2005]. @carp2009 observed reduced alpha power following errors, implying that changes in post-error behavior are influenced by increased cortical arousal.

Of interest in this study are differences in post-error adjustments between conditions containing either mainly _response speed_ or _evidence quality_ errors. We will obtain EEG-measures and investigate post-error changes using ANOVA. We predict post-error changes in behavior of all types to be more pronounced following _response speed_ errors. Errors due to poor evidence quality should not induce large changes in cognitive processes, as the underlying cognitive processes were not at fault when committing the error.

## Hypotheses
H1: Post-error slowing is more pronounced in conditions containing mainly _response speed_ errors.
H2: ERN is more negative in conditions containing mainly _response speed_ errors.
H3: Pe is more positive in conditions containing mainly _response speed_ errors.
H4: Alpha power decreases are more pronounced in conditions containing mainly _response speed_ errors.

## EEG
We will use 64 and blabla
ERN will be measured
Pe will be measured
alpha will be measured

## Analysis
We will need at minimum N participants according to power analysis.

## Limitations
