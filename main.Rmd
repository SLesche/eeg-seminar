# Introduction
_Post-error slowing_ (PES) describes the increase in response times following errors. Work on PES has mostly focused on describing the cognitive processes underlying this slowing. Here, effects of the _response stimulus interval_ seems to play a key role in deciding what processes underlie PES. PES has been replicated in many tasks and with a wide range of subjects. So far, there has been little agreement on the type of task used to most reliably estimate PES. Evidence points to large differences in the magnitude of and processes underlying PES depending on procedural factors such as the RSI and the presence or absence of feedback. Tasks used do not only differ in procedural factors such as RSI and feedback, but also require different cognitive processes when completing the task. Different processes required may lead to different effects of errors on those processes. This in turn can cause cognitive processes underlying PES to vary between tasks.

To date, little research has been dedicated towards studying the effects of errors themselves. _Error awareness_ for example seems to play a role in determining the magnitude of errors. With unaware errors leading to less PES. Tasks may differ in the amount of awareness participants have of their committed errors. This would also induce between task variability in PES.

This proposal focuses on a recent development aiming to account for within-task variability in PES. Recently, a group of researchers proposed two different types of errors that lead to different changes in post-error behavior. In their work, @damaso2022 differentiated between two types of errors, _evidence quality_ and _response speed_ errors as a potential explanation for within-task variability @damaso2020. Evidence quality errors occur when participants are unsure of the correct response and default to guessing. Response speed errors on the other hand are due to participants responding too quickly. Had they waited for more evidence to accumulate, they would have made the correct choice. Response speed errors occur because participants responded with too little caution. This leads to faster response times in error trials. Evidence quality errors on the other hand are independent of caution, they occur due to low evidence accumulation rates. This leads to slower response times in error trials.

@damaso2020 predicted that only response speed errors should lead to increases in response times post-error. They attribute this to the participants becoming _more_ cautious following a response-speed error. Evidence quality errors should have no effect on caution, leading to reduced PES, or even post-error speeding. 

@damaso2020 found these behavioral differences in PES depending on the prevalent type of error. In conditions with a higher frequency of response speed errors, they observed traditional PES. In conditions with mostly evidence quality errors however, they observed
